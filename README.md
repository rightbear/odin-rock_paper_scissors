Project: Rock Paper Scissors

This is the third project to work in the "JavaScript Basics"

(2025/01/04) I complete the part 1 of this project with knowledges of JavaScript I learned in the course. I use basic JavaScript syntax this project such as variable, conditional and function. With advices in Assignment of the project, I use the concept of for-loop and wile-loop in later course as well. This activity strengths my skills in JavaScript.
